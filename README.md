## Root-Level Files

### `README.md`

This file provides an overview of the project, including its structure, setup instructions, and usage.

### `requirements.txt`

Lists all the Python dependencies required to run the project. For example:

```
torch==1.10.0
transformers==4.14.1
pytorch3d==0.6.1
trimesh==3.9.4
scikit-learn==0.24.2
```

You can install the dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### `config.yaml`

This file contains global configurations for the project, such as hyperparameters, file paths, and model-specific settings. Example content might look like:

```yaml
model:
  type: "text_to_3d"
  encoder: "clip"
  decoder: "voxelnet"

training:
  batch_size: 32
  learning_rate: 0.001
  epochs: 100

data:
  train_data: "data/processed/train_data"
  test_data: "data/processed/test_data"
```

### `.gitignore`

Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git (e.g., temporary files, model weights, logs).

```bash
data/
outputs/
*.log
*.h5
*.pkl
```

## Folder-Level Descriptions

### `data/`

Contains all the data files used for training, testing, and evaluating the model.

- **`raw/`**: This folder holds the raw, unprocessed data, including text descriptions, 3D model files, and any other input data.
- **`processed/`**: Here you'll find the data that has been preprocessed and is ready for use in training. This could include tokenized text, normalized images, or any other transformed data.
- **`splits/`**: If the dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets, those splits will be stored here.
- **`README.md`**: A description of the data used in the project. This file outlines how the data was collected, preprocessed, and split.

### `models/`

Contains the model code and configurations.

- **`model_1/`**: The first model (e.g., text encoder like CLIP). Includes:
  - `model.py`: Defines the architecture for this model.
  - `weights/`: Folder to store pre-trained weights for the model.
  - `config/`: Model-specific configurations (e.g., hyperparameters, settings).
  - `utils.py`: Additional functions that are specific to this model (e.g., custom layers, activation functions).
- **`model_2/`**: If there is a second model (e.g., 3D decoder like VoxelNet), it will be structured similarly to `model_1`.

- **`README.md`**: Describes the models used in the project, including their purpose, configuration, and how they interact with other models.

### `outputs/`

Contains all the results generated by the model, including logs, checkpoints, and final outputs.

- **`checkpoints/`**: Stores model checkpoints during training (so you can resume training or evaluate later).
- **`logs/`**: Contains logs of training and evaluation processes, such as loss curves, accuracy, or other metrics.

- **`results/`**: Stores the final output of the project, such as generated 3D models, predictions, or visualizations.

- **`README.md`**: A description of what the output folders contain and how to interpret the results.

### `scripts/`

Scripts for training, evaluation, and inference.

- **`train.py`**: The main script for training the model(s). It loads the data, defines the training loop, and saves model checkpoints.

- **`evaluate.py`**: Used for evaluating the trained model on test data, including calculating metrics like accuracy, loss, etc.

- **`inference.py`**: Script to run inference and generate outputs (e.g., generating a 3D model from text input).

- **`README.md`**: Provides an overview of how to use the scripts and run the project.

### `utils/`

Contains utility functions that are shared across the project.

- **`data_preprocessing.py`**: Functions for preprocessing the data, such as tokenizing text, normalizing images, or converting 3D models to a specific format.

- **`evaluation_metrics.py`**: Contains functions to evaluate the performance of the models, such as loss functions, accuracy, precision, recall, etc.

- **`README.md`**: Describes the utility functions, their purpose, and how to use them.

## How to Use the Project

### 1. **Set Up the Environment**

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai_project.git
cd ai_project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**

Before training, you'll need to preprocess the data. Run the preprocessing script to prepare the data:

```bash
python scripts/preprocess_data.py
```

This will tokenize text descriptions and convert 3D models into a suitable format for the training process.

### 3. **Training the Model**

To train the model, run:

```bash
python scripts/train.py
```

This will start the training process, saving checkpoints and logs in the `outputs/` folder.

### 4. **Evaluate the Model**

After training, you can evaluate the model with:

```bash
python scripts/evaluate.py
```

This will generate evaluation metrics and store them in the `outputs/` folder.

### 5. **Run Inference**

To generate predictions (e.g., convert text descriptions to 3D models), use the inference script:

```bash
python scripts/inference.py --text "A red car"
```

This will generate the 3D model based on the text description and save it in the `outputs/results/` folder.
